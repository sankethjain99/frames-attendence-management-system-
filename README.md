# Attendance Management System
<Strong>Facial</Strong> Recognition Based Attendance Management E-System

This project is based on facial recognition and uses tkinter and openCV. It takes multiple images of our face and creates a hologram of the images and then the model is trained within minutes. The attendance of a student is marked and is saved in an excel sheet, which is then forwarded to the faculty.
